Open Ended Project for CSE210 Class

My program lets a user create a soccer player, enter match statistics, view their performance, and receive a personalized training plan. I try to demonstrate all four Object Oriented Programming principles in this project like abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## How to Use the Program
1. Run the program.
2. Create your player by entering a name, age, and position.
3. Use the menu to:
   - Add match stats  
   - View total stats  
   - View weaknesses  
   - Generate a training plan  
   - View your player rating (0–100)


- To show creativity: Includes PassingDrill + rating system.

# Object-Oriented Design
- **Abstraction:** Clear classes for Player, Match, TrainingDrill, TrainingPlanner.  
- **Encapsulation:** Private fields with public behaviors.  
- **Inheritance:** Striker, Midfielder, Defender derived from Player.  
- **Polymorphism:** Overridden methods in drill types and player types.
